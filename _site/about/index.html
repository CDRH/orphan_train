    <h1>ABOUT THE PROJECT</h1>
    <div class="paper">
        <p class="essay_paragraph">This project makes available the names of over 2,000 children and youth sent to the
            state of Nebraska between 1854 and 1929 by the Orphan Train movement. The term “Orphan Train” refers broadly
            to the placing-out system initiated by the Children’s Aid Society in 1853 that sought to give New York
            City’s homeless or orphaned children new homes. The placing-out system is largely attributed to creating the
            foundations for the modern-day foster care and children’s welfare system in the U.S. While not all children
            placed in new homes during this period rode a literal train, the term has become synonymous with the system
            of placement that gave them new homes.</p>
        <p class="essay_paragraph">No comprehensive list of Orphan Train riders exists today, but it is estimated that
            over 200,000 children from the state of New York and other eastern cities were sent to over 40 different
            states across the U.S. between 1854 and 1929. It is estimated that anywhere between 3,000 and 4,000 children
            arrived in the state of Nebraska between those years.</p>
        <p class="essay_paragraph">This project hopes to contribute to the development of a list for the state of
            Nebraska and provide the means to assist the families of descendants and research alike in discovering more
            about the riders and their stories.
        </p>

        <h2>A Note on Methods</h2>
        <p class="essay_paragraph">The nature of the placing-out system causes difficulties in locating and
            reconstructing the lives of the Orphan Train children. Their records are typically scattered in various
            archives and online databases across the U.S. today, sometimes making research difficult. In addition,
            records held by the institutions that housed and placed the children often restrict access to records for
            privacy concerns, only reserving access for family members seeking more information about their relatives.
            Thus, determining whether a child was an Orphan Train rider, or where they went, can prove to be difficult.
        </p>
        <p class="essay_paragraph">However, various local newspapers, annual reports by aid societies, federal and state
            census records, collaboration with other research institutions, as well as various reminiscences by the
            riders themselves have proven to be valuable resources in constructing more comprehensive lists of the
            children that took part in this movement. It is through these means that this project has generated a list
            of riders to Nebraska.
        </p>

        <h2>Special Thank You to the Castner Family
        </h2>
        <p class="essay_paragraph">A special thank you goes to the members of the Castner family for their dedication
            and hard work to uncover more about the children sent to Nebraska. The information provided on Nebraska’s
            Orphan Train riders was first collected by the Castner family, whose relatives (Albert, Clarence, and Clark
            Castner) rode an Orphan Train to Madison, Nebraska on November 20, 1908. This project would not have been
            possible without their generous contributions.
