            </b>
            The 3 siblings were surrendered to a NY orphanage around 1891. Emma was adopted by the Palmers of Port Jervis, NY; James was sent to Omaha. The 1900 census lists William as a servant and farm laborer in Caroline Thieman's household. By 1905, William had "recently" been married. They settled in Cass Co., NE, where William was a farmer. Between 1920 and 1930, William and Emma divorced. According to unverifiable information on Find-a-Grave, William remarried to Matilda Kopinitz on March 13, 1928 in Houston, TX. In 1930, William and Matilda lived in Houston, TX, where William was a painter and contractor.
