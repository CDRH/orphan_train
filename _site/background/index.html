  <h1>A SHORT HISTORY OF THE ORPHAN TRAINS</h1>
  <div class="paper">

    <h2>New York: A Growing Urban City</h2>
    <p class="essay_paragraph">In 1790, New York City’s population stood at about a meager 30,000 individuals compared
      to the millions of inhabitants that would occupy the city a century later. New York City’s population would grow
      to over 200,000 in 1830 and reach 800,000 inhabitants by 1860. In 1900, the city would experience a dramatic
      explosion in population reaching a staggering 3.5 million.</p>

    <p class="essay_paragraph">The explosion in the city’s population stemmed from a multitude of factors. With easy
      access to the Atlantic seaboard, New York City was becoming a central hub for international trade and business, as
      well as becoming a center for industrial development. Many young men and women from rural communities came to the
      city to find work within the growing wage labor system.</p>

    <p class="essay_paragraph">By 1825, with the completion of the Erie Canal (which allowed greater access and
      transportation to the Great Lakes and further West), New York became the leading jumping off point for newly
      arrived European immigrants seeking better fortunes in America. Yet, unable to complete their journey due to the
      cost of travel, some immigrants remained stranded in the growing urban city.</p>


    <h2>Changing Social Conditions: A Need for Reform</h2>
    <p class="essay_paragraph">The dramatic increase in population and radical transformation of the American economy
      led to a significant shift in urban social conditions. The large influx of eager young folks and immigrants
      seeking work led to an oversupply in the labor force, driving wages down in the city.</p>

    <p class="essay_paragraph">The inability to secure stable jobs and wages for growing families coupled with poor city
      planning led to an increase in crowded tenement-style housing. These unhealthy living conditions made these
      “poorer classes” more susceptible to various outbreaks of disease among both adults and children (children
      regularly lost one or both parents, leading to an increase in child homelessness).</p>

    <p class="essay_paragraph">To supplement the income of their parent(s), especially in the event of a mother or
      father’s death, children regularly sought wage labor to help support their families. Other times, single parents
      left their children in the city (temporarily, and often with relatives) while seeking employment outside the city,
      hoping to return.</p>

    <p class="essay_paragraph">The greater visibility of children laboring in industrial jobs, sleeping on the streets
      due to homelessness, or stealing food due to hunger radically reimagined ideas of childhood in the American
      nation.</p>


    <h2>The Children’s Aid Society & Foundling Hospital</h2>
    <p class="essay_paragraph">As the visibility of children wandering the street increased alongside the
      criminalization of youth vagrancy (homelessness) throughout the 1840s and 1850s, urban reform movements slowly
      emerged to meet the needs of poor children in the city. Many of these reform movements had started out as
      religious impulses against what was perceived to be growing vice in urban centers, following the stirrings of the
      Second Great Awakening (beginning in the 1850s).</p>

    <p class="essay_paragraph">In 1853, Protestant minister, Charles Loring Brace initiated a century-long movement with
      the founding of the Children’s Aid Society (CAS). Brace and other agents working with the CAS were determined to
      rescue street children growing up in the heart of the vice and place them into the homes of hard-working families
      who would provide them with religious instruction, basic education, and industrial training.</p>

    <p class="essay_paragraph">In 1869, the New York Foundling Hospital added to the top organizations dedicated to
      placing children in new homes. Different than the CAS, the Foundling Hospital was primarily responsible for
      placing infants and toddlers, mostly girls, into Catholic homes across the Nation.</p>

    <p class="essay_paragraph">Though these organizations, among hundreds more, are most known for sending children to
      new homes in the west, the placing-out system only constituted a portion of the solutions they provided for urban
      children.</p>


    <h2>Finding Homes for Children: The Allure of the West</h2>
    <p class="essay_paragraph">The West captivated the attention of many urban reformers as an idyllic setting for
      children to grow up. Reformers believed that by placing children with the farm families in the west, urban
      children could grow up in good Christian homes and learn the meaning of a good day’s work, far away from the
      growing vice of the city.</p>

    <p class="essay_paragraph">The desire to send children to western farming communities was coupled with a national
      demand in farm labor. Agricultural communities were experiencing a shift in small-scale production to larger
      markets by the mid nineteenth century, putting a demand on labor needed to generate higher quantities.</p>

    <p class="essay_paragraph">Sending children to the west could fill this need, for children’s labor had always been
      an essential element of family farms. Thus, the placement of children in the homes of farm families was believed
      to be a natural solution to meet the demands of farm labor and placements for children. As the demand for farm
      labor dwindled in the late 1920s, so did the Orphan Train placements.</p>


    <h2>Legacies of the Movement: The Children’s Experiences</h2>
    <p class="essay_paragraph">The Children’s Aid Society and other sending organizations typically required family
      consent to place children in new homes unless the child was proven to have no living relatives. (It was common for
      children to have at least one living parent or relative who was unable to afford to provide for the child).</p>

    <p class="essay_paragraph">Children, in groups between a few months to 17 years, rode the trains across the west
      with a sending agent and additional help, depending on the age of the children in the group. The trains that
      carried children increased in conditions over time. Children typically took minimal items with them on the trains
      because the sending organizations relied heavily on donated materials from the people of New York and communities
      in which the trains stopped along the route.</p>

    <p class="essay_paragraph">At each stop, children were taken off and brought to a public meeting house, typically a
      courthouse, church, or opera house, where families could come and pick the children to bring home. The child was
      required to go willingly with the family, allowing children some control over the process of placement.</p>

    <p class="essay_paragraph">Families taking children were expected to furnish the children with basic necessities
      (i.e. food, clothing, education) and expected to sign a contract with placing organizations to outline the terms
      of the exchange. The intention of the contract was to alleviate any potential for abuse on part of the foster
      family, and supervisors continued to check-in on the child year after year.</p>

    <p class="essay_paragraph">Despite the best intentions to supervise and vet all families taking the children,
      scholars have found numerous instances of abuse in the Orphan Train’s placing-out system (physical, emotional, and
      even sexual). Still, many of the children placed into homes were adopted into loving and caring families. The
      experiences of the children placed west in states like Nebraska vary greatly, and many of their stories can be
      found among this site.</p>
